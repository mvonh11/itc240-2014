//any value that needs to persist from one line to another requires a property. The object ($bus) needs a property (defined in the class Bus) to contain values that persist between method calls. such as "speed"


	
//your BUS class (defined here in bus.php) should have the following properties and methods	--(written as functions inside bus class.?)

/*1)armed - A property that starts as false, and turns true once the bus has passed 50mph. This represents the bomb on the bus.

2)exploded - A property that also starts out as false, and is set to true if the bomb is armed and the bus goes less than 50mph.

3)setSpeed() - A function that takes a single argument, which is the speed of the bus. If this speed is higher than 50mph and the bomb has not previously been armed, this function should arm it.
 
4)getSpeed() - A function that RETURNS the current speed of the bus.

5)trigger() - A function that can be called by a bitter madman that immediately explodes the bomb.*/


/*Instantiate/create your object
Classes are the blueprints/templates of php objects. Classes don't actually become objects until you create an instance ( property or method) of it ...thus creating the object.
Instantiation: creating an instance of an object in the server's memory.*/

//SET: set an object's properties using the methods/setters you create. (SET means insert data into an object) 

//GET: getter methods are used to access the data held in an object â€¦ this is the SAME DATA we inserted into our objects using the setter methods. 
//methods and properties of a class are accessed with the skinny arrow (->) operator.

//You use -$this- to access properties and to call other methods of the current class. 
//it's best practice to create separate php pages that only contain your classes and access with an "include"

//when you test, you'll be inserting and retrieving data from the BUS objects
